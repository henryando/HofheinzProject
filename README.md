# HofheinzProject

Henry, Sam, and Chris's ELE 456 project. We are reproducing the figures from Hofheinz et. al. "Synthesizing arbitrary quantum states in a superconducting resonator" (Nature 2009).

This is just a tentative readme! You guys should feel free to make any changes you want, and we can talk about how to divide the work. 

I'm not yet sure how it will make sense to split up the code. I suspect we will want to have one file which just defines a class for the Hamiltonian of the system, and maybe a class for generating the appropriate pulse sequences? Then possibly, for each figure, a script for generating the data, and a script for creating the figures. A rough outline would therefore be:

1. qubitandresonator.py: Imports qutip, and within qutip framework gives us two classes:

   1. QubitAndResonator, which just has the information about the Hamiltonian of the system, and can be fed OpSequences to do operations.

   2. OpSequence, which is a class we use to store information about the sequences of operations we perform on the object.

2. figXdata.py: generates the data needed for Figure X. In cases where there are lots of subplots with different numbers, we could have the number be a command line input! It would be very official that way. 

3. figXplot.py: does plotting and formatting using the data generated by figXdata.py. Could have command line inputs to specify subplots!
